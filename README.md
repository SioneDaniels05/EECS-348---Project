Project Part 2 - Software Requirements Specifications
The following is a short introduction to our document as a whole:

Purpose: Define the calculator's behavior, constraints and operations.
Scope: Covers expression, parsing, operator support, error handling, and user interface.

Product Perspective: Command-line calculator using C++ for parsing and evaluation.
Memory Constraints: Optimized recursion and data structures.
User Characteristics: Basic arithmetic knowledge required.

Functionality: Handle, +, -, *, /, %, **, parentheses, and error messages.
Non-functional: User interface, usability, and performance

Project Part 3 - Software Architecture Design
The following is a short introduction to our document as a whole:

Purpose: Define the architecture of the program being made.
Scope: To guide a reader in the design of the architecture of our program.

Architecture: Hierarchical logic architecture is defined with goals and classes.
Interface: Example what the interface may look like with examples of valid and invalid inputs.
Quality: Handling invalid inputs, error checking, and watching for vulnerabilities in the code.
